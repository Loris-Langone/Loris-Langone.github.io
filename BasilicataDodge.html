            <p class="lead"><b>Overview:</b><br>
                "Basilicata Dodge" is a 2D game developed in Unity where the player controls a wild boar and must dodge falling rocks. The game features colorful graphics with a background soundtrack that creates an engaging atmosphere. The player's score increases based on the number of successfully dodged rocks, while the game becomes more challenging as the speed of the rocks increases.
