                The "Overdose" project is a short film aimed at raising awareness about the dangerous consequences of drug use and inspiring a healthy and positive life. Here is a possible description of the project:
                <br><br>
                Overdose
                <br>
                They only know each other through drugs, and this gathering marks the beginning of an event that will lead them to a dramatic reflection. A fifth boy arrives, the "pusher", and the transaction takes place: money in exchange for illegal substances. However, the situation takes a tragic turn when the pusher, after leaving the boys, returns home and dies of an overdose in the bathtub.
                <br>
                The death of the pusher serves as a turning point for the four boys. With remorse and awareness of the devastating consequences of drug use, they decide to change their lives. Each of them embarks on a different path: one becomes a basketball player, another a kitesurfer, another opens a gym, and the last becomes a drummer.
                <br>
                Through their new passions and commitment to a healthy life, the boys convey a message of hope and positivity. The short film concludes with a strong appeal against drug use, inviting viewers to reflect on their choices and embrace a drug-free lifestyle.
